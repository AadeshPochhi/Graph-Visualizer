        <p class="q">What Is A star Search algorithm</p>
        A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals
        </p>
        <p class="q"> Why A star Search Algorithm ? </p>
        Informally speaking, A* Search algorithms, unlike other traversal techniques, it has “brains”. What it means is
        that it is really a smart algorithm which separates it from the other conventional algorithms. This fact is
        cleared in detail in below sections.
        And it is also worth mentioning that many games and web-based maps use this algorithm to find the shortest path
        very efficiently.

        <p class="q">What Is Breadth First Search algorithm</p>
        Breadth first search is a graph traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from root node and explores
        all the neighbouring nodes. Then, it selects the nearest node and explore all the unexplored nodes. The
        algorithm follows the same process for each of the nearest node until it finds the goal.

        <p class=q>What Is Depth First Search algorithm</p>
        Depth first search (DFS) algorithm starts with the initial node of
        the graph G, and then goes to deeper and deeper until we find the goal node or the node which has no children.
        The algorithm, then backtracks from the dead end towards the most recent node that is yet to be completely
        unexplored.
